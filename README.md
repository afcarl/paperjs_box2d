Demo of using Box2D with paper.js

I'm greatful reading Dan Shiffman's Nature of Code book (http://natureofcode.com/) to learn processing and various cool stuff.

Recently, he has ported the examples to javascript/p5.js, and has posted some examples on how to use box2d-html5.js library in one of the chapters.

I am a fan of paper.js, so I experimented with translating some of his code to use paper.js to draw simple shapes.

Any comments or suggestions:
